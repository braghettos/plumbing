// bare "resource mapping not found" substring, and a %w-wrapped typed *meta.NoKindMatchError.
// Here we pin down the REMAINING branches of isRESTMappingMiss (read in client.go) so every
// variant it claims to match is exercised exactly once and false-positives stay excluded:
//   - meta.IsNoMatchError on a DIRECT (unwrapped) typed error,
//   - the "no matches for kind" substring on its own,
//   - the "ensure CRDs are installed first" substring on its own,
//   - two more unrelated errors (a wrapped one, and one whose text merely resembles but does
//     not contain any sentinel substring) that must NOT trip the matcher.

// populated its cache. It returns the concrete *DeferredDiscoveryRESTMapper because that is the

// TestMapperResetPicksUpNewlyRegisteredKind proves the reset-then-retry CONTRACT that

//
//	c.cachedClients.mapper.Reset()
//	// re-init the action config and run install() a second time
//
// The load-bearing claim is that mapper.Reset() causes the very next mapping attempt to observe a
// kind that was NOT resolvable before (the stale-discovery-cache bug: a composition CRD created
// moments earlier in the same bootstrap is invisible until the cache is dropped). We drive the
// SAME concrete *DeferredDiscoveryRESTMapper the client holds:
//
//	attempt 1 (pre-registration)  -> RESTMapping MUST miss with a NoKindMatchError
//	                                  (this is precisely what isRESTMappingMiss classifies true)
//	register the CRD's resource   -> simulate the CRD add the informer would have raced
//	Reset()                       -> the single invalidation Install performs before its retry
//	attempt 2 (post-Reset)        -> RESTMapping MUST now succeed
//
// Without the Reset() between the two attempts the MemCacheClient keeps serving its first snapshot
// and attempt 2 would miss identically — so this asserts the reset is causally required, which is
// the whole point of the fix the cdc must wire.
//
// What an envtest/integration test would ADD (and this unit deliberately does not attempt, because
// client.Install requires a real chart render + apiserver and there is no unexported seam to
// intercept the two install() calls — see client.go, the mapper field is a concrete type, not an
// injectable interface): that Install invokes Reset EXACTLY ONCE and retries EXACTLY ONCE end to
// end. That behavioral count is covered by the integration suite in client_test.go (build tag
// integration). Here we prove the mechanism the retry relies on.
